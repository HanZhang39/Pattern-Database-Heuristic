# Pattern-Database-Heuristic
This repo contains a Python implementation of Additive Pattern Database heuristc for sliding puzzle as described in this [paper](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/JAIR/Vol22/JAIR-2209.pdf)


Although the Python implementation is much slower regarding time, it has similar node expansion and estimated heuristic as reported
